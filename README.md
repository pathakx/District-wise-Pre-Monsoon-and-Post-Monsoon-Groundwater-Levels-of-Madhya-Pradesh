# 🌊 District-wise Pre-Monsoon and Post-Monsoon Groundwater Levels of Madhya Pradesh

This project analyzes **district-wise groundwater level variations** in **Madhya Pradesh (India)** for **Pre-Monsoon** and **Post-Monsoon** seasons using data analytics and visualization techniques.

The analysis helps identify **seasonal groundwater trends**, possible **declining zones**, and patterns useful for **water resource management** and decision making.
